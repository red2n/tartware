# Architecture Decision Records

This directory stores Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that capture significant technical choices and their rationale. Follow the template below when authoring a new ADR.

## Workflow

1. Copy `ADR-000-template.md` to a new file with the next sequential number (e.g., `ADR-001-new-decision.md`).
2. Update the metadata fields (`Status`, `Deciders`, `Date`).
3. Write concise context, decision, and consequences sections.
4. Link related ADRs to maintain traceability.
5. Submit the ADR in the same pull request as the related implementation work when possible.

Need guidance? See `docs/hybrid-microservices-implementation-plan.md` for the current architectural roadmap.
