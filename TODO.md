## TODO

1. **Expose reservation reads through the API Gateway** (done)
   - Added `/v1/reservations` proxy in `Apps/api-gateway/src/server.ts` so GET calls hit `core-service`.
   - UI already targets `/v1/reservations` via `ReservationApiService`.

2. **Unblock tenant directory access for system admins** (done)
   - `TenantApiService` now calls `/v1/system/tenants`; gateway already proxies `/v1/system/*` to core-service.
   - System-admin token is used for `/system/*` calls so impersonation isn’t required to list tenants.

3. **Send the correct token for command execution** (done)
   - `/v1/commands/:name/execute` uses impersonation token while `/v1/commands/definitions` uses the system-admin token.
   - UI already blocks submissions without active impersonation.

4. **Route command-center traffic through the gateway** (done)
   - Gateway proxies `/v1/commands/**` via `serviceTargets.commandCenterServiceUrl`.
   - Removed Angular dev proxy; UI now points directly at the gateway base.
   - (Later) Ensure api-gateway deployment env includes `COMMAND_CENTER_SERVICE_URL` and `SETTINGS_SERVICE_URL` so k8s routes to in-cluster services.

5. **Fix the `TenantsComponent` TypeScript compile error** (done)
   - Stray `readonly tenantTypes = TenantTypeEnum.options;` line is already removed in `UI/super-admin-ui/src/app/pages/tenants.component.ts`.

6. **Make the settings service reachable** (done)
   - Added Settings Catalog page in the system-admin UI that reads `/v1/settings/catalog` and `/v1/settings/values` through the gateway.
