# AI Assistant Instructions for Tartware PMS Project

## Required Tools
- ALWAYS use `rg` (ripgrep) instead of grep for text search
- ALWAYS use `fd` or `fdfind` instead of find for file search
- These tools are faster and the project is configured for them

## Database Setup
- ALWAYS use ./setup-database.sh for database operations
- Never manually run SQL scripts - the setup script handles everything
- The script supports two modes:
  - Direct mode (default): ./setup-database.sh
  - Docker mode: ./setup-database.sh --mode=docker

## File Creation Rules
- NEVER create .md files for explanations or documentation
- User does not want markdown documentation files
- Provide explanations in chat only, not in files
- Focus on code and executable scripts only

## Work Style
- Execute tasks immediately without asking permission
- Don't explain what you're going to do - just do it
- Keep responses concise and action-oriented
- Show results, not plans

## Code Standards
- Use modern Python 3 with type hints where appropriate
- Follow existing project structure in scripts/data/
- All data loaders should handle errors gracefully
- Use environment variables for database connection (DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD)
