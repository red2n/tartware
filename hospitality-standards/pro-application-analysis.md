## Gap Analysis by Tartware Service

### Existing services that need extension

| Service | Gaps to fill |
|---------|-------------|
| **core-service** | Departments |
| **guests-service** | Richer profile preferences |
| **rooms-service** | Phone extensions |
| **billing-service** | Payment gateway config UI |
| **notification-service** | Additional template types (AR statement, invoice, deposit due, payment link, welcome script, rooming list) |
| **guest-experience-service** | Self-service config management |

### New modules needed (not currently any Tartware service)

| Module | PRO Features | Priority | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Template Engine** | 12 template types (folio, confirmation, cancellation, invoices, etc.) | HIGH | Guest-facing communications are table-stakes for any PMS |
| **Comp Accounting** | Enable/disable, defaults, authorizers, departments, reasons | ~~MEDIUM~~ **COVERED** | `comp_authorizers` + `comp_transactions` + `comp_property_config` tables in `04-financial/72_comp_accounting.sql` |
| **Function Rooms** | Setup, configure, policies for meeting/event spaces | MEDIUM | Full-service and convention hotels; skip for limited-service |
| **Import/Export** | Property, profiles, reservations, housekeeping bulk operations | MEDIUM | Essential for property onboarding and data migration |
| **Travel & Transport** | Travel modes, locations, transport types, charges | LOW | Nice-to-have; most properties handle externally |
| **Alerts Engine** | Universal rules-based alerts across reservation/guest/group events | LOW | Can be deferred; basic notifications already exist |
| **Pet Management** | Pet types, charges | ~~LOW~~ **COVERED** | `pet_types` + `pet_registrations` tables in `09-reference-data/09_pet_types.sql` |
| **Guest Satisfaction** | Complaint/compliment categories, dashboard | LOW | Can start as a reporting feature |
| **Data Retention** | GDPR retention policy engine | ~~LOW~~ **COVERED** | `data_retention_policies` + `data_breach_incidents` in `10-compliance/` |
| **Phone/PBX** | Emergency calling, call allowances | LOW | Niche integration; most modern properties use cloud PBX |

## Recommended Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 — Core PMS Parity (High Impact) ✅ COMPLETE
- ~~Extend core-service: buildings, outlets, meal periods~~ → `14_buildings.sql`, `15_outlets.sql`
- ~~Create `reason_codes` reference table (room move, rate override, deposit override)~~ → `08_reason_codes.sql` (23 seeds)
- ~~Comp accounting tables (comp_authorizers, comp_transactions, comp_property_config)~~ → `72_comp_accounting.sql`
- ~~Extend settings-service: lost business tracking~~ → `60_lost_business.sql`
- ~~Property-level feature flags~~ → `16_property_feature_flags.sql` (14 seeds)
- ~~Events and announcements~~ → `17_property_events.sql`
- ~~Pet management~~ → `09_pet_types.sql`
- All 13 tables verified in PostgreSQL, verify scripts pass, Zod schemas built

### Phase 2 — Template & Communication Completion (NEXT)
- Add AR statement, invoice, deposit due, payment link, welcome script, rooming list template types to `communication_templates`
- Folio routing rule templates
- Scheduled deposit due email system

### Phase 3 — Remaining Partials & Small Gaps

- Guest self-service config management (guest-experience-service)
- Phone extensions on rooms (rooms-service)

### Phase 4 — Polish & Admin
