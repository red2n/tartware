## Demand Forecasting

### Forecast Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Historical data | Same period prior years |
| On-the-books | Current reservations |
| Pickup pace | Rate of new bookings |
| Event calendar | Local demand drivers |
| Market intelligence | Competitor data |
| Economic indicators | Travel trends |

### Forecast Horizon

| 8-30 days | Operational | Rate adjustments, restrictions |
| 31-90 days | Strategic | Pricing strategy, campaigns |
| 91-365 days | Budget | Seasonal pricing, contracts |

## Pricing Strategies

### Dynamic Pricing

| Strategy | When to Apply |
|----------|---------------|
| Raise rate | Demand exceeds supply |
| Lower rate | Pickup below forecast |
| Add restrictions | Protect high-demand dates |
| Remove restrictions | Stimulate demand |

### Price Positioning

| Position | RevPAR Goal | Risk |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Rate leader | Maximize ADR | Low occupancy |
| Occupancy leader | Maximize occupancy | Low ADR |
| RevPAR balanced | Optimal RevPAR | Balanced |

## Inventory Controls

### Overbooking Strategy

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Historical no-show % | By day of week, segment |
| Cancellation % | By rate type, lead time |
| Walk risk | Cost of relocation |
| Compensation policy | Brand standards |
| Alternate inventory | Nearby properties |

### Overbooking Formula

```
Overbook Level = (No-Show % + Cancel %) × Rooms × Safety Factor
Example: (5% + 8%) × 200 rooms × 0.8 = 21 rooms overbook
```

## Segment Management

| Corporate | Medium | Stable | Medium |
| Group | Low-Medium | Volume | Low |
| Wholesale | Net rate | Advance commitment | Low |

### Displacement Analysis

| Right rate? | Estimate transient pickup at higher rate |
| Right dates? | Check pattern (day of week impact) |
