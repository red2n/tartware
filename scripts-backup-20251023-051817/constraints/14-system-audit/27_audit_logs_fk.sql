-- User reference (required - who performed the action)
-- Note: SET NULL to preserve audit trail if user is deleted

COMMENT ON CONSTRAINT fk_audit_logs_user ON audit_logs IS 'User who performed the audited action';

-- Note: entity_id is NOT constrained as it can reference any table
-- This allows audit logs to persist even if referenced entity is deleted
